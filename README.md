# dithering
Image / Video dithering in the terminal and browser. Usage:

- Browser Version: 
  - Navigate to the "dithering" folder
  - `npm install -g live-server` if not already installed
  - `live-server` which should open a localhost tab automatically
  - In the localhost tab click on the "browser" folder

- Terminal Version:
  - Navigate to the "terminal" folder
  - `npm install` to install dependencies
  - `node index.js help -h` for the help menu

- Video Version uses the same steps as browser version except the folder name.
